Overview
This is a simple calculator program written in x86 assembly language that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and modulus. The program prompts the user to input two operands and an operator, and then it displays the result.

Features
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Modulus (%)
How It Works
Operand Input: The program prompts the user to input two operands (one at a time). The user can enter single-digit values, and the program processes them.
Operator Input: After both operands are entered, the program asks the user to input an operator (+, -, *, or %).
Calculation: Based on the operator entered, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation:
Addition: Adds operand 2 to operand 1.
Subtraction: Subtracts operand 2 from operand 1.
Multiplication: Multiplies operand 1 by operand 2.
Modulus: Calculates the remainder of operand 1 divided by operand 2.
Result Display: The result is displayed one digit at a time in the console.
